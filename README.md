DeepChess: An Implementation
I came across DeepChess and decided to implement it to learn TensorFlow and to experiment with Deep Learning methods.

To play: Install python-chess, and then from the main directory, run: python game.py

To train: This model was trained with:

CUDA 7.5

Tensorflow 0.10.0

Run python train.py to train the model on the data available in the folder 'pGames' Some older network checkpoints can be found in the folder 'net'.
